# AXR - C++

This entire project was written in C++, it supports running commands from an input json:

* pmonline - outputs all the uninstalled security patches
* query - outputs the result of a wmi query (wql)

But then we figured out its best to move to C# which is much easier.
We are still keeping this project, it might help us in the future.
