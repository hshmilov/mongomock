# National Vulnerability Database files

This folder contains raw and parsed files which are downloaded and parsed automatically
from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) of NIST.

It contains information needed for Axonius to search for vulnerabilities.

## How to use
Upon each deployment, the update script should be called (manually or automatically).
It downloads the latest db and parses it.
